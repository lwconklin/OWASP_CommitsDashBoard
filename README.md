# OWASP_CommitsDashBoard
Proof of concept creating a DashBoard of projects in GitHub for OWASP. This code was written as a proof of concept to see if we can create a tool that would create as output a table for MediaWiki to show in www.owasp.org the wiki page would show what projects are active by using commits to determine project activity/health.

A few push backs/issues.

If project as been forked.

Information is on https://www.openhub.net/orgs/OWASP.

A lot of prpjects in github have OWASP in the description but not as the owner.
